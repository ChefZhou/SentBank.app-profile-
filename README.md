Most of the content in this project is derived from Jonas Schmedtmann's course. I don't claim full ownership of the material; it's used here purely for practice as part of my portfolio.

This project showcases a fictional banking interface. I've implemented an additional function to determine if a transaction qualifies as a loan and added indicators in the transaction list to improve the user experience.

In the original loan script, there was no stopping point for the loan limit, and a bug allowed for unlimited borrowing. I've fixed this issue to enhance functionality.

I've also personalized the branding and user interface to reflect my style, making it more than just a direct copy and more suitable for a portfolio piece.

Additionally, I've included alert pop-up windows to give the webpage a realistic touch. Much like real banking apps, each action has a corresponding reminder, and monetary values don't appear instantly but rather after a short delay, mimicking real-world processes.
